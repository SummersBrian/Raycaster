# Raycaster
Project for my Computer Graphics course in Spring 2015 at UMD. Had to create a raycasting/raytracing
program that would detect collisions between rays and shapes in the world and render those shapes
on the display. Includes: point lighting, directional lighting, ambient lighting, lambertian lighting,
and specular highlights. This project was done in C++.
